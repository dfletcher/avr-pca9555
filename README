Summary
-----------------------

AVR driver for PCA9555. Wraps all PCA9555 functions in a simple C interface.

The PCA9555 driver requres Peter Fleury's I2C master library, which is
included in this package. AVRs with a TWI interface can replace the
i2cmaster.S source in the makefile with twimaster.c, which uses the AVR's i2c
hardware. If using the software i2cmaster.S version, configure the I2C pins
at the top of the i2cmaster.S file.
