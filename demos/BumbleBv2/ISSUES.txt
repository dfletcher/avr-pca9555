MCU = atmega32u2 issue
----------------------
There is a bug in the current avr-libc stopping `atmega32u2` working as an MCU
setting. This setting mainly just adds more ram over the BumbleB v1's
at90usb162, and .hex files made for at90usb162 appear to work on atmega32u2
microcontrollers, so this demo actually runs fine if we just specify MCU =
at90usb162. Once the toolchain catches up, this will be permanently fixed.
